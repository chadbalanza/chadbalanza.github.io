			About Me
		</h1>
		
		<p>
			I'm an Art Director, living in the San Francisco Bay Area. I became interested in Front-End Web Design and Development because I want to learn how to code and better communicate with the developers within my company. I have a background in graphic design, but not an extensive one in web development.
		</p>
		
		<h2>
			My Mission
